# Assignment4-Reinforcement-Learning

All code for this assignment was borrowed from Juan Jose here: https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4 and
slightly modified. To recreate my tests clone the repository in IntelliJ, Eclipse, or and IDE with support for Maven. To recreate
my tests navigate to the EasyGridWorldLauncher.java file (first MDP) or the HardGridWorldLauncher.java (second MDP). Inside the file
change the number of iterations to the desired number, right click on the file and select run. The MDP and the policy map
should be displayed and all pertinent data will be output as .csv files. I did not have room for references in
the paper, so they are listed below:
